# ***Face Recognition for Student Attendance System Using FaceNet Siamese One shot Learning***

<p>The purpose of this repository is to develop an automatic student attendance system (an application of face recognition). The proposed system is developed usnig FaceNet model. FaceNet offers a single representation that can be used for face recognition, verification, and clustering purposes. It transforms each facial image into a Euclidean space where the distances between points reflect the similarity between faces. In other words, an image of person A will be positioned closer to all other images of person A than to images of any other individuals within the dataset. The FaceNet model is trained  using a Siamese architecture coupled with a triplet loss function. Once the model is trained, we can employ one-shot learning for facial recognition by extracting the facial embedding of any new person. The detailed information about FaceNet can be found in the original paper titled "<a href = https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832> FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"</a>. The block diagram of the system is illustrated in the following figure. </p>

When a student is in front of the laptop webcam, the system captures each frame, identifies faces, and then crops and resizes these faces to extract facial embeddings using the pre-trained FaceNet model. Subsequently, it computes the cosine similarity between these embeddings and the images of other students stored in the database. A very low cosine distance score indicates a match, while a large distance score suggests a mismatch. Finally, the system sorts the distance scores for each student in ascending order, and if the lowest score is below a certain threshold, it returns the corresponding student ID as the matched student.
